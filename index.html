      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>Hello, I am <strong>Wenhua (Wren) Qi 戚文华</strong>. This is my personal website.</p>
      <p>Research Interest: Labour Economics (specifically, topics related to technology and crime), Law and Economics, Industrial Organization. Ironically, my interest in technology's impact was sparked by witnessing the rise of AI, like AlphaGo, which reshaped the very board game Go (Weiqi) I had a longtime passion for.</p>
      <p>My journey has been about finding focus in different arenas: first as a competitive pistol shooter (winning a provincial silver medal before the event was, sadly, removed from the Olympics), and now as a researcher. When I need to step away from research, you'll find me hiking or taking walks at somewhere, usually fueled by the search for a good cup of coffee or bubble tea (￣▽￣)~* </p>
