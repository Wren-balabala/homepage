          <em>Purpose:</em> The connection between digital manufacturing technologies (Industry 4.0) and the environment has sparked discussions on firms' disclosure of negative information on pollutant emissions and the pursuit of positive environmental outcomes. However, very few studies explore how it relates to a firm's robot usage and its mechanism. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impacts of robot penetration on firms' environmental governance in China.<br><br>

          <em>Design/methodology/approach:</em> The ordered probit model (and probit model) are employed and empirically tested with a sample of 1,579 Chinese listed firms from 2010 to 2019.<br><br>

          <em>Findings:</em> The study reveals a negative relationship between robot usage and the disclosure of negative indicators and a U-shaped relationship between robot usage and positive environmental outcomes. Among the sample, nonstate-owned enterprises (SOEs) display unsatisfactory performance, while heavily polluting industries disclose more information on pollutant emissions. The robot–environmental governance nexus is conditional on firm size, capital intensity and local economic development.<br><br>

          <em>Originality/value:</em> The study proposes a fresh view of corporate environmental governance to assess the environmental implications of robot adoption. It also contributes to identifying the curvilinear, moderating and heterogenous effects in the robot–environment nexus. The results provide rich policy implications for the development of industrial intelligence and corporate environmental governance in the circular economy (CE) context.

        <strong>Short-Term vs. Long-Term: The Dual Pathways of Urban Technology and Innovation in Boosting Energy Efficiency</strong>

        Urban development has always faced the dilemma of choosing between short-term, quick-return technologies and long-term technologies with extended payback periods. Would this pay-off exist in terms of its impact on energy? Based on artificial intelligence (AI) technology data, this paper investigates the distinct impacts of Short-Run Technological Transformation (SRTT) represented by robot adoption, and Long-Run Innovation and Transformation (LRIT) reflected in numbers of AI patents, on improving energy efficiency in Chinese cities from 2008 to 2019. We also specifically focus on how these effects vary by industry agglomeration (SPE) and production orientation. Our findings indicate that SRTT yields immediate but diminishing returns, while LRIT demonstrates gradual, long-term effects. Additionally, the impacts of SRTT and LRIT are significantly influenced by a city's level of SPE and whether it is oriented towards domestic markets or exports. These findings emphasize the need for tailored policy interventions on AI development based on industrial and market characteristics.
